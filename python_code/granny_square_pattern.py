# TODO 

# general tasks/features to implement
# - translate this logic to js for ease of UI later âœ…
    # - learn how to write js code tests
# - generate visuals for given pattern's stitches as svg
    # - go through generated pattern list w maybe a case argument to identify which pattern it is
    # - create, choose & transform relevant stitch visuals accordingly to compile a svg pattern
# - UI that goes through stitches in order & colour codes where you're at

# extension tasks: 
# - which previous stitch relevant stitches need to connect to?
# - other base patterns & vis
